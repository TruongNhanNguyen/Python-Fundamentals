# Python Fundamentals

Ilcome to Python Fundamentals, a comprehensive collection of Python code implementations for basic and advanced concepts in the Python programming language. In this project, you will find the following:

## Basic Concepts
- Variables and data types
- Operators and expressions
- Control flow statements (if-else, for loops, while loops)
- Function

## Advanced Concepts

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Iterators and generators
- Decorators
- Exception handling

## Data Structures

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Graph
- Heap
- Other data structures will be updated later


## Algorithms

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (Linear search, Binary search, etc.)
- Other type of algorithms will be updated later


Each concept and data structure has been thoroughly documented with clear explanations and examples to help you understand how they work and how to use them effectively. I also provide test cases for each implementation to ensure that they are working correctly.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, simply clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the appropriate folder for the concept or data structure you wish to learn about. Each implementation has its own dedicated folder with the necessary files and documentation.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TruongNhanNguyen/Python-Fundamentals.git
```

## Contributing

I alway welcome contributions to this project. If you have an implementation of a concept or data structure that is not included here, or you have found an error in our code, please feel free to submit a pull request.
