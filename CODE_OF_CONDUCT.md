# The Code of Conduct

The Python Fundamentals project is committed to creating an inclusive and respectful environment for all members of our community. We expect all participants, including contributors, maintainers, and users, to abide by the following Code of Conduct.

1. Be respectful. Do not engage in any form of discrimination, harassment, or hate speech, including but not limited to, that based on age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin.

2. Be constructive. Share your opinions and ideas in a way that is productive and respectful. Avoid personal attacks and name-calling, and instead focus on the issues at hand.

3. Be open-minded. Listen to others' perspectives and be willing to consider different viewpoints.

4. Be accountable. If you witness or experience any form of misconduct, please report it to the project maintainers. All reports will be treated with confidentiality and investigated promptly.

5. Be collaborative. Work together to find solutions that benefit the community as a whole.

Violations of this Code of Conduct will not be tolerated. Anyone who engages in conduct that is detrimental to the community may be removed from the project at the discretion of the maintainers.
