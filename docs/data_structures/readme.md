## Data Structures

Data Structures are the ways in which data is organized and stored in a computer.

Some common data structures include:

- Arrays: An array is a collection of items stored in contiguous memory locations. The items can be of any data type and are accessed using an index. Arrays are useful for storing and manipulating large amounts of data of the same type, and they offer fast O(1) access to individual elements. However, they are not efficient for inserting or deleting items in the middle of the array, as it requires shifting all the elements after the insertion/deletion point.

- Linked Lists: A linked list is a collection of items where each item points to the next one. Each item is called a node, and it contains two fields: the data and the reference to the next node. Linked lists are useful for inserting and deleting items in the middle of the list, as it only requires updating the references of the previous and next nodes. However, they are not as efficient as arrays for accessing individual elements, as it requires traversing the list from the beginning.

- Stacks: A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure where items are added and removed from the top. It is often implemented using an array or a linked list. Stacks are useful for implementing undo/redo functionality, backtracking, and expression evaluation.

- Queues: A queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure where items are added to the back and removed from the front. It is often implemented using an array or a linked list. Queues are useful for scheduling tasks, implementing breadth-first search, and maintaining a buffer.

- Trees: A tree is a hierarchical data structure where each item has one parent and zero or more children. Each item is called a node, and the topmost node is called the root. Trees are useful for organizing data in a hierarchical manner, such as file systems and web pages. Some common types of trees include binary trees, AVL trees, and B-trees.

- Graphs: A graph is a collection of interconnected items, where each item is called a node and the connections are called edges. Graphs are useful for representing relationships between items, such as social networks and transportation networks. Some common types of graphs include directed graphs and undirected graphs, weighted graphs and unweighted graphs.

- Heaps: A heap is a type of tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, which states that the value of a parent node is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the values of its children. Heaps are useful for implementing priority queues, where the item with the highest or lowest priority is always at the top of the heap.

- Hash Tables: A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values. Hash tables are useful for implementing dictionaries, where keys are mapped to values, and for implementing sets, where each item is a key without value.

- Bloom Filters: A bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an item is a member of a set. Bloom filters have a fixed size and are useful for saving memory space in cases where the set is too large to be stored in memory.

- Tries: A trie, also called a prefix tree, is a tree-based data structure that is used to store a collection of strings. Each node in the trie represents a character in a string, and the path from the root to the node represents a prefix of a string. Tries are useful for implementing autocomplete functionality and for searching for words in a dictionary.

- Disjoint Sets: A disjoint-set data structure, also called a union-find data structure, keeps track of a partitioning of a set of elements into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It allows to efficiently perform operations such as testing whether elements are in the same subset, and merging subsets together.

- Skip Lists: A skip list is a data structure that allows for efficient search, insertion and deletion of elements. It is essentially a linked list with multiple levels. The idea is that each element in the list has a probability of being promoted to the next level, where it can be skipped over.

These are just a few examples of the many different types of data structures that exist. Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best data structure to use depends on the specific problem and the operations that will be performed on the data.

## Implementation in Python

Python has built-in support for many common data structures, as well as standard libraries that provide additional data structures. Here's how you can implement some of the data structures I mentioned earlier in Python:

### Array

Python lists can be used as arrays. Lists are mutable and support fast O(1) access to individual elements, but are not efficient for inserting or deleting items in the middle of the list. Here's an example of how to create an array of integers in Python

```python
my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Linked List

Python doesn't have a built-in implementation of linked lists, but you can create your own using classes. Here's an example of a simple singly-linked list implementation in Python

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def insert(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node
```

### Stack

Python lists can also be used as stacks. The `append()` method can be used to add items to the top of the stack, and the `pop()` method can be used to remove items from the top of the stack. Here's an example of how to create a stack of integers in Python

```python
my_stack = []
my_stack.append(1)
my_stack.append(2)
my_stack.append(3)
print(my_stack.pop()) # prints 3
```

### Queue

Python lists can also be used as queues, but the `deque` class from `collections` module is more efficient. The `append()` method can be used to add items to the back of the queue, and the `popleft()` method can be used to remove items from the front of the queue. Here's an example of how to create a queue of integers in Python

```python
from collections import deque

my_queue = deque()
my_queue.append(1)
my_queue.append(2)
my_queue.append(3)
print(my_queue.popleft()) # prints 1
```

### Tree

Python doesn't have a built-in implementation of trees, but you can create your own using classes. Here's an example of a simple binary tree implementation in Python

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None, left=None, right=None):
        self.data = data
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class BinaryTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None
```

### Graph

Python doesn't have a built-in implementation of graphs, but you can create your own using classes or dictionaries. Here's an example of how to create an undirected, unweighted graph using a dictionary in Python

```python
graph = {'A': ['B', 'C'],
         'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
         'C': ['A', 'F'],
         'D': ['B'],
         'E': ['B', 'F'],
         'F': ['C', 'E']}
```

This graph is represented using a dictionary, where the keys are the vertices (nodes) of the graph, and the values are lists of the vertices that are connected to the key vertex. This is called an adjacency list representation.

You can also use classes for representing the graph, where each vertex is represented as an object, and each edge is represented as a reference between two vertex objects.

### Heap

Python has `heapq` module which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm. It can be used to create min-heaps and max-heaps. Here's an example of how to create a min-heap of integers in Python

```python
import heapq

my_heap = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
heapq.heapify(my_heap)
```

### Hash Table

Python has built-in support for dictionaries, which are implemented as hash tables. A dictionary maps keys to values, and it offers fast O(1) access to individual elements. Here's an example of how to create a dictionary in Python

```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

### Bloom Filter

Python has a library called `pybloom-filter` which provides an implementation of Bloom filters. Here's an example of how to create a Bloom filter in Python

```python
from pybloom_live import BloomFilter

my_bloom_filter = BloomFilter(capacity=1000, error_rate=0.1)
my_bloom_filter.add("hello")
my_bloom_filter.add("world")
print("hello" in my_bloom_filter) # prints True
```

### Tries

Python doesn't have a built-in implementation of tries, but you can create your own using classes or dictionaries. Here's an example of how to create a trie in Python using a dictionary

```python
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = {}

    def insert(self, word):
        current = self.root
        for letter in word:
            if letter not in current:
                current[letter] = {}
            current = current[letter]
        current['*'] = True
```

### Disjoin Set

Python has a library called `disjoint_set` which provides an implementation of disjoint-set data structure. Here's an example of how to create a disjoint set in Python

```python
from disjoint_set import DisjointSet

ds = DisjointSet()
ds.make_set("a")
ds.make_set("b")
ds.make_set("c")
ds.union("a", "b")
```

### Skip List

Python doesn't have a built-in implementation of skip lists, but you can create your own using classes. Here's an example of how to create a skip list in Python

```python
class SkipList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.level = 0
        self.head = SkipListNode(float("-inf"), self.level)
        self.tail = SkipListNode(float("inf"), self.level)
        for i in range(self.level + 1):
            self.head.next.append(self.tail)
            self.tail.prev.append(self.head)

    def insert(self, key, value):
        update = [None] * (self.level + 1)
        current = self.head
        for i in range(self.level, -1, -1):
            while current.next[i].key < key:
                current = current.next[i]
            update[i] = current

        current = current.next[0]
        if current.key == key:
            current.value = value
        else:
            level = random_level()
            if level > self.level:
                for i in range(self.level + 1, level + 1):
                    update[i] = self.head
                self.level = level
            new_node = SkipListNode(key, level, value)
            for i in range(level + 1):
                new_node.next.append(update[i].next[i])
                update[i].next[i].prev[i] = new_node
                update[i].next[i] = new_node
                new_node.prev.append(update[i])

```
