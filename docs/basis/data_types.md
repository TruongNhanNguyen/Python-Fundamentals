# Data Types

In Python, data types are used to define the type of values that a variable can hold. Python supports several built-in data types, which include:

1. Numbers: There are three types of numbers in Python: integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Integers are whole numbers and are represented by the int data type. Floating-point numbers are numbers with decimal points and are represented by the float data type. Complex numbers are numbers with real and imaginary parts and are represented by the complex data type.
    
    ```python
    x = 5      # integer
    y = 3.14   # floating-point
    z = 2 + 3j # complex number
    ```

2. Strings: Strings are sequences of characters and are represented by the str data type. Strings can be enclosed in single or double quotes.

    ```python
    x = "Hello World" # string enclosed in double quotes
    y = 'Hello World' # string enclosed in single quotes
    ```

3. Lists: Lists are ordered collections of items and are represented by the list data type. Lists can contain items of different data types, and items in a list are accessed using their index.

    ```python
    x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # list of integers
    y = ['a', 'b', 'c'] # list of strings
    ```

4. Tuples: Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning that once created, their items cannot be modified. Tuples are represented by the tuple data type.

    ```python
    x = (1, 2, 3) # tuple of integers
    y = ('a', 'b', 'c') # tuple of strings
    ```

5. Dictionaries: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs and are represented by the dict data type. Dictionaries are used to store data in a more structured way.

    ```python
    x = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30} # dictionary
    ```

6. Sets: Sets are unordered collections of unique items and are represented by the set data type.

    ```python
    x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} # set of integers
    y = {'a', 'b', 'c'} # set of strings
    ```

7. Boolean: Boolean data type represent the logical state of True or False.

    ```python
    x = True
    y = False
    ```

It's important to note that, Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the type of a variable can change dynamically at runtime. For example, you can convert one data type to another using built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()` and so on.

```python
x = 5
print(x, type(x)) # 5 <class 'int'>
x = str(x)
print(x, type(x)) # '5' <class 'str'>
```

Understanding the different data types in Python and knowing how to work with them is important for writing effective and efficient code. It's also important to choose the right data type for the task at hand, for example, using a set instead of a `list` when you need to check if an item is already in a collection or using a `tuple` when you don't need to change the values.
