## Basic Concepts

When learning the basics of the Python language, it is important to understand the following concepts:

1. **[Variables](variable.md)**: Variables are used to store values in Python. You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (`=`), and then use the variable name to refer to the value in your code.

2. **[Data types](data_types.md)**: Python supports several built-in data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, lists, and dictionaries. Understanding the different data types and how to work with them is important for writing effective Python code.

3. **[Control structures](control_structures.md)**: Control structures allow you to control the flow of execution in your code. Python supports several control structures, such as `if-else` statements, `for` and `while` loops, and functions.

4. **[Indentation](indentation.md)**: Unlike other languages, Python uses indentation to indicate the structure of a program. The indentation level of a block of code determines its level of nesting and scope.

5. **Comments**: Comments are used to add notes and explanations to your code. In Python, comments begin with the `#` symbol.

6. **[Basic Operators](operators.md)**: Python supports several basic operators, such as arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) and comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).

7. **[Exception handling](exception_handling.md)**: Exception handling allows you to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of your code. Python provides try-except blocks to handle exceptions.

8. **[String formatting](string_formatting.md)**: String formatting allows you to create strings that include values from variables. Python provides several ways to format strings, including the `format()` method and `f-strings`.

These are the basic concepts of Python. Once you have a solid understanding of these concepts, you can move on to more advanced topics such as working with modules and libraries, object-oriented programming, and more.
