# Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are a set of instructions that take a graph as input and perform operations on it, such as searching, sorting, and traversing the graph. Graphs are data structures that consist of a set of vertices (or nodes) and edges that connect them.

Some common types of graph algorithms include:

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- A* Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- Topological Sorting

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This algorithm explores all the vertices of a graph or all the nodes of a tree in breadth-first order. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbours. It can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: This algorithm explores all the vertices of a graph or all the nodes of a tree in depth-first order. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. It works by maintaining a priority queue of unvisited nodes and always visiting the node with the smallest distance first.

4. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: This algorithm is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm but it can also handle negative edge weights. It works by iteratively relaxing the edges, that is, updating the distance of a vertex if a shorter path is found.

5. **A* Algorithm**: This algorithm is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide the search, making it more efficient in finding the shortest path in a graph.

6. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: This algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. It starts with an empty tree and at each step, adds the edge with the smallest weight that connects two different connected components.

7. **Prim's Algorithm**: This algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. It starts with an arbitrary node, and at each step, adds the edge with the smallest weight that connects the current tree to a new node.

8. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a graph. It works by iteratively updating the distance between all pairs of vertices using dynamic programming.

9. **Topological Sorting**: This algorithm is used to sort the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in a linear order such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before vertex v in the order.

These are some of the most popular and widely used graph algorithms. Each algorithm has its own time and space complexity and is suitable for different types of data and problem.
