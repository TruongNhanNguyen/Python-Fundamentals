# Calculus

Calculus is a branch of mathematics focused on finding tangent lines and rates of change. It consists of two main branches: Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus. Differential Calculus is concerned with finding the derivative of a function, while Integral Calculus is concerned with finding the definite integral of a function. Both branches are fundamental to understanding the behavior of functions and are used in a wide range of fields, including physics, engineering, and economics.

## Branches of Calculus

1. Differential Calculus:

   - Deals with the study of how a function changes as its inputs change The central concept is the derivative, which describes the rate of change of a function at a given point
   - Derivatives can be used to find minimum and maximum points, determine the concavity of a function, and study the behavior of a function near a point of inflection
2. Integral Calculus:

   - Deals with the accumulation of quantities, and the finding of total values over an interval
   - The central concept is the definite integral, which gives the total change in the quantity being studied
   - Integrals can be used to calculate the area under a curve, solve problems involving motion and accumulation, and find the solution to certain differential equations
