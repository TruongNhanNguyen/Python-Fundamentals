# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of vectors and matrices, as well as linear transformations and systems of linear equations. It is a fundamental tool in many areas of mathematics, science, and engineering, including physics, computer science, economics, and statistics.

Some of the key concepts in linear algebra include vector spaces, linear independence and dependence, bases and dimension, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, and inversion.

Linear algebra is also closely related to other areas of mathematics, such as calculus, differential equations, and optimization. It is used in many practical applications, such as solving systems of equations, finding the least-squares solution to a set of data, and solving optimization problems.

Linear algebra has a lot of applications in Machine Learning, such as Principal Component Analysis, Singular Value Decomposition, Eigenvalue decomposition, and many more.
