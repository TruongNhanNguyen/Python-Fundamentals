# Type Hints

In Python 3.5 and later versions, the language includes support for type hints, also known as type annotations. Type hints are a way to specify the expected types of variables, function arguments, and return values in your code. These hints are not enforced by the Python interpreter, but they can be used by third-party tools such as IDEs and linters to provide better code analysis and validation.

Type hints use a syntax similar to variable annotations, and they are usually placed before the variable name, separated by a colon. Here is an example of how to use type hints in a Python function

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

In this example, the function `greet` takes a single argument `name` of type `str` and returns a value of type `str`. The type hints are used to specify that the `name` argument should be a string and the function should return a string.

You can also use type hints for variables, like this

```python
name: str = "Alice"
age: int = 30
```

In this example, the variable `name` is of type `str` and the variable age is of type `int`.

Type hints can also be used for more complex types such as `lists`, `tuples`, and custom classes. For example

```python
names: List[str] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
point: Tuple[float, float] = (3.0, 5.0, 6.0)
```

Here is an example of how to use type hints for a custom class

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

person: Person = Person("Alice", 30)
```

In this example, the class `Person` has an `__init__` method that takes two arguments, `name` and `age`, both of type `str` and `int` respectively. And the variable person is an instance of the `Person` class.

Type hints can also be used to specify the return type of a function, as shown in this example

```python
def get_persons() -> List[Person]:
    return [Person("Alice", 30), Person("Bob", 40)]
```

This function returns a `list` of `Person` objects.

Type hints are not enforced by the Python interpreter, but they can be used by third-party tools such as IDEs, linters, and type checkers to provide better code analysis, autocompletion and refactoring suggestions, and also to catch type errors before running the code.

In summary, Type hints is a way to specify the expected types of variables, function arguments, and return values in your code, they make your code more readable, easy to understand and also allows third-party tools to provide better code analysis. It's an optional feature in Python, but it's a good practice to use it in your code to make it more robust and maintainable.
